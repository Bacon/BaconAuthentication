BaconAuthentication User Guide
==============================

BaconAuthentication is a general purpose authentication module for
Zend Framework 2. It comes with a pluggable authentication service which allows
to not only create simple username/password authentication, but also to easily
integrate third-party authentication (like OpenID or OAuth), as well as
two-factor authentication.
